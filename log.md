# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a very simple readmore link to reveal more content.

**Thoughts:** This is my first day so I'm starting simple and small until I figure out what I should start learning. This is plain JS stuff. I used the free sample chapter from the A Book Apart book JavaScript for Web Designers. 

**Link to work:** The files are currently in this forked repo. Need to organize this.

### Day 2: March 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a totally bananas image mover. Today I was running short on time and energy and started late, so I didn't have any idea prepared. I just added a way to move the position of an image on the page by clicking a button. It's all about using event listeners, and using style.position through JS to move stuff around.

**Thoughts:** Starting to think that one hour of coding, depending on the project, is not enough time to build anything substantial. Or maybe I'm just slow.

### Day 3: March 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today was mostly about studying a code example to understand the logic behind it. I followed this [tutorial](https://javascript.info/js-animation) on JavaScript animations. It seems simple enough, but there is a lot going on with these 20 or so lines on the script.

### Day 4: March 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to solve this [code excercise](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#14.1) from the Eloquent JavaScript book. I had the right idea at the beginning of looping through the object with a for loop, but I was only creating one instance of the elements. So after an hour at taking a stab at it, I clicked the reveal solution button. I'm still not entirely 100% sure how the Object.keys with paramates like field, data[0] and all that work, but I get the gist that it's looping first through the keys and the second time around it loops through the properties.

**Thoughts:** Need to look into the forEach method more.

### Day 5: March 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a responsive navigation menu, with the so called hamburger icon. I've done these before, but I usually just find code elsewhere, or just use the bootstrap framework. My main goal was to figure out how to do it without googling code examples on how to do these. I knew that first I had to work with CSS to set display: none according to window width size. I only took about 10 lines of JavaScript to get it working. I'm sure there are better ways to do these, but I'm pretty proud of myself for solving this without looking for examples. The idea is to get myself more comfortable and understand the logic of JS.
