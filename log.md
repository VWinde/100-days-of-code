# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Tried creating a Responsive Toggle Navigation Menu.

**Thoughts:** I really suck at creating a decent responsive navigation toggle menu. I really haven't mastered this design pattern. To be honest, there's a lot more css involved in this stuff that I don't understand 100% like position, the ::before and ::after stuff. I need to get this stuff. All I wanted was to see if I could create a cool ease-out transition effect. I was following a code snippet from the Ethan Marcotte's Patterns and Principles book.

### Day 2: Sept 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started a brand new course on Treehouse called Object Oriented Javascript by Example [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** This hasn't been completed yet. This is a game called "4 in a Row". Basically Connect 4. It uses Object classes. It's a really super cool project, but I'm still not at the level to building something like this on my own. I have to start thinking of coding project ideas that are at my level. It's gonna be a process.

### Day 3: Sept 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still Treehouse's  Object Oriented Javascript by Example course. [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** This course is way over my head. I'm following along, but this is way to big of a project for me. It's also been a long day for me, so I'm pretty fused. At least I'm getting quicker at typing code. At least I'm learning that there's still so much I need to learn.
