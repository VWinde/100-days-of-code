# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a very simple readmore link to reveal more content.

**Thoughts:** This is my first day so I'm starting simple and small until I figure out what I should start learning. This is plain JS stuff. I used the free sample chapter from the A Book Apart book JavaScript for Web Designers. 

**Link to work:** The files are currently in this forked repo. Need to organize this.
