# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a very simple readmore link to reveal more content.

**Thoughts:** This is my first day so I'm starting simple and small until I figure out what I should start learning. This is plain JS stuff. I used the free sample chapter from the A Book Apart book JavaScript for Web Designers. 

**Link to work:** The files are currently in this forked repo. Need to organize this.

### Day 2: March 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a totally bananas image mover. Today I was running short on time and energy and started late, so I didn't have any idea prepared. I just added a way to move an the position of an image on the page by clicking a button. It's all about using event listeners, and using style.position through JS to move stuff around.

**Thoughts:** Starting to think that one hour of coding, depending on the project, is not enough time to build anything substantial. Or maybe I'm just slow.
