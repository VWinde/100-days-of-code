# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Tried creating a Responsive Toggle Navigation Menu.

**Thoughts:** I really suck at creating a decent responsive navigation toggle menu. I really haven't mastered this design pattern. To be honest, there's a lot more css involved in this stuff that I don't understand 100% like position, the ::before and ::after stuff. I need to get this stuff. All I wanted was to see if I could create a cool ease-out transition effect. I was following a code snippet from the Ethan Marcotte's Patterns and Principles book.

### Day 2: Sept 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started a brand new course on Treehouse called Object Oriented Javascript by Example [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** This hasn't been completed yet. This is a game called "4 in a Row". Basically Connect 4. It uses Object classes. It's a really super cool project, but I'm still not at the level to building something like this on my own. I have to start thinking of coding project ideas that are at my level. It's gonna be a process.

### Day 3: Sept 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still Treehouse's  Object Oriented Javascript by Example course. [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** This course is way over my head. I'm following along, but this is way to big of a project for me. It's also been a long day for me, so I'm pretty fused. At least I'm getting quicker at typing code. At least I'm learning that there's still so much I need to learn.

### Day 4: Sept 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Treehouse's  Object Oriented Javascript by Example course. [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** Ok. This is super complex. I just copied the code provided from the lessons or would simply pause the video to type it. Of course I would stop and watch the video and go through the code a bit to understand what's happening. I think I understand what's going on on a general level. This a very component like way of coding. Very similar to React I would say, but with plain ol' vanilla JavaScript. Every component in the the game is a class. One the most complicated pieces of code is the checkForWin method in the Game class. If there's anything I learned in the past three days about this, is that there's so much I need to learn. not just JavaScript, but computer programming in general. I wouldn't know how to code up an application or a game because I have a hard time breaking things down to tiny little systems like that. 

I'm gonna keep pushing tho. I need to go down a bit, and find simpler things to do. The game should work tho.

### Day 5: Sept 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Going back to simpler stuff. 

**Thoughts:** I had an idea for a personal project. It's a work related idea, so I don't think it's appropriate if I share all the details, but the gist of the project, or what I want the app to do, is to filter through an array of objects. The object or array will catalogue employee names and their skills. According to their skills, I can arrange them in a particular way. 

I think this is a more purposeful way of deliberately practice coding with JavaScript. 

Everyday it's a struggle for me. But I'm gonna keep on. Linking to the code, but right now it does absolutely nothing.

### Day 6: Sept 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Shooters Project 

**Thoughts:** Right around the end of the coding hour, I finally figured out how to accomplish something by myself. I was attempting to loop through an array of objects using more of the newer array iteration methods, but I was not getting the result I wanted. After a while of digging and looking for ways to loop through arrays and objects, I finally landed a simple solution with a for loop. I think I finally really understand how a for loop works. 

It isn't much what I accomplished today, but it's a start.
