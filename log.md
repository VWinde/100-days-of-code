# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Tried creating a Responsive Toggle Navigation Menu.

**Thoughts:** I really suck at creating a decent responsive navigation toggle menu. I really haven't mastered this design pattern. To be honest, there's a lot more css involved in this stuff that I don't understand 100% like position, the ::before and ::after stuff. I need to get this stuff. All I wanted was to see if I could create a cool ease-out transition effect. I was following a code snippet from the Ethan Marcotte's Patterns and Principles book.
