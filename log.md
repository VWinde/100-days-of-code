# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Tried creating a Responsive Toggle Navigation Menu.

**Thoughts:** I really suck at creating a decent responsive navigation toggle menu. I really haven't mastered this design pattern. To be honest, there's a lot more css involved in this stuff that I don't understand 100% like position, the ::before and ::after stuff. I need to get this stuff. All I wanted was to see if I could create a cool ease-out transition effect. I was following a code snippet from the Ethan Marcotte's Patterns and Principles book.

### Day 2: Sept 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started a brand new course on Treehouse called Object Oriented Javascript by Example [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** This hasn't been completed yet. This is a game called "4 in a Row". Basically Connect 4. It uses Object classes. It's a really super cool project, but I'm still not at the level to building something like this on my own. I have to start thinking of coding project ideas that are at my level. It's gonna be a process.

### Day 3: Sept 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still Treehouse's  Object Oriented Javascript by Example course. [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** This course is way over my head. I'm following along, but this is way to big of a project for me. It's also been a long day for me, so I'm pretty fused. At least I'm getting quicker at typing code. At least I'm learning that there's still so much I need to learn.

### Day 4: Sept 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Treehouse's  Object Oriented Javascript by Example course. [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** Ok. This is super complex. I just copied the code provided from the lessons or would simply pause the video to type it. Of course I would stop and watch the video and go through the code a bit to understand what's happening. I think I understand what's going on on a general level. This a very component like way of coding. Very similar to React I would say, but with plain ol' vanilla JavaScript. Every component in the the game is a class. One the most complicated pieces of code is the checkForWin method in the Game class. If there's anything I learned in the past three days about this, is that there's so much I need to learn. not just JavaScript, but computer programming in general. I wouldn't know how to code up an application or a game because I have a hard time breaking things down to tiny little systems like that. 

I'm gonna keep pushing tho. I need to go down a bit, and find simpler things to do. The game should work tho.

### Day 5: Sept 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Going back to simpler stuff. 

**Thoughts:** I had an idea for a personal project. It's a work related idea, so I don't think it's appropriate if I share all the details, but the gist of the project, or what I want the app to do, is to filter through an array of objects. The object or array will catalogue employee names and their skills. According to their skills, I can arrange them in a particular way. 

I think this is a more purposeful way of deliberately practice coding with JavaScript. 

Everyday it's a struggle for me. But I'm gonna keep on. Linking to the code, but right now it does absolutely nothing.

### Day 6: Sept 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Shooters Project 

**Thoughts:** Right around the end of the coding hour, I finally figured out how to accomplish something by myself. I was attempting to loop through an array of objects using more of the newer array iteration methods, but I was not getting the result I wanted. After a while of digging and looking for ways to loop through arrays and objects, I finally landed a simple solution with a for loop. I think I finally really understand how a for loop works. 

It isn't much what I accomplished today, but it's a start.

### Day 7: Sept 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Shooters Project 

**Thoughts:** Did a bit of code refactoring. I realized that I was repeating the same for loop three times, when that was completely unnecessary. There was really just three conditions. I managed to use the Math.floor(Math.random() method as a way to print out to console random shooters. Still figuring out how would I have a shooter not have the same location on the same dip. There's probably going to be some more conditional statements to get this working. 

I'm really starting to enjoy this. Loving the results I'm getting. Coding is so cool.

### Day 8: Sept 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day

**Thoughts:** Today was more of a study day. I completed a short Treehouse course on Objects, which is useful or could be useful in the future for my Shooters project. I also completed some Free Code Camp Excercises. There's a lot there that I can keep doing. A the end of the hour I played some more with my shooters project. Still trying to wrap my head around something that a human brain could understand and do without describing every single tedious step. Basically, the idea is to automate and print out something that can take an hour for a person to do. I'm positive that I'll find the right approach.

### Day 9: Sept 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day / Vue Js Basics Treehouse Course

**Thoughts:** Started a course on Treehouse on Vue Js. Digging it. Basic day. Vue is basically a class object. Pretty cool.  

**Link to work:** [Vue JS](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/wEXQoz)

### Day 10: Sept 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day / Vue Js Basics Treehouse Course

**Thoughts:** Second day of going through Treehouse Vue Js Basics course. So far I think this is a really nice framework. It's certainly a bit easier to get into than something like React. The templating syntax already feels familiar to me since I have played with things like Jekyll and customizing Wordpress themes.

### Day 11: Sept 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day / Vue Js Basics Treehouse Course

**Thoughts:** Woke up super early this morning. At about 4:30am. Trying to mix this up to see if this would be a better time. I'm almost done with the course. I'm working on building a flashcard web app that lets you add a card. It's really cool.

### Day 12: Sept 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Vue Js Basics Treehouse Course

**Thoughts:** Had a day off today so started early. I completed the Vue JS Basics course. I'm really digging Vue. React was a challenge to grasp, but I still think it's an awesome tool. Vue on the other hand is very easy to grasp. I think I'm gonna keep learning and playing with Vue. 

The flash Card app was completed. I also completed a [practice course on treehouse.](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/practice-vuejs-templating)

### Day 13: Sept 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Practice Vue Js

**Thoughts:** Woke up that the crack of dawn to start my coding hour. I'm really loving Vue. It feels more intuitive to use. I worked on a [Treehouse practice course on Vue Js list rendering](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/practice-vuejs-list-rendering.

### Day 14: Sept 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Random Day

**Thoughts:** I feel like today was an unproductive day. I did one hour, but I wasn't really focused on something in particular. I started out working on one of my projects. I started last night working on it. I just want to make a simple webapp where you can add cards with info, you can edit an instance of a card, and you can add or delete cards. I just been struggling to give this data a structure that makes sense. I tried making it with Vue, but I can't wrap my head around it. I'm having a hard time simplifying it.

### Day 15: Sept 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today was a good Day

**Thoughts:** It's funny. Today I didn't really go for a specific end goal, but I ended with a more functional web app. But more importantly, I figured things out on my own by taking each idea step by step. I'm still playing with Vue and I'm slowly falling in love with it. I don't know if it's because it's easier to understand or if this daily coding challenge is starting to help me think like a coder, but today simply was a good day. What was good about today is that I felt that everything that I've been studying and learning so far is starting to materialize in my brain somehow.

### Day 16: Sept 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Code Pairing and Some More Vue

**Thoughts:** Today I screencasted and chatted with a coder buddy. We talked about Vue, frontend, and coding in general. We are starting an emoji memory game. After that I started another [intro Vue JS course](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js) It's another nice intro. The intro courses are free, but there's a lot of stuff there. Haven't finished it yet, but what I liked about it is that they really teach you the concepts behind each of the vue directives like v-bind, v-show vs v-if, and their shortcuts.

### Day 17: Sept 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Early morning session

**Thoughts:** Got up about 5:30am today. Started my hour around 5:40 or so. Mostly it was a study session. Read more of the Vue docs. Created a Vue component and tried to implement it to the emoji cards.

### Day 18: Sept 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: The Tweet Box

**Thoughts:** Started working on another tutorial today. I think this is a good one. It's not too above my level, but not too low. I'm past the intro tutorials, so this excercise is perfect. It's basically a recreation of the Twitter compose interface. [A Vue.js introduction for people who know just enough jQuery to get by
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vue-js-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by-eab5aa193d77) This is seriously helping cement the the concepts on how a Vue instance works.

### Day 19: Sept 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished with the Tweet Box

**Thoughts:** Finished with the [Tweet Box tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vue-js-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by-eab5aa193d77) Not exactly sure how the photo uploading functionality works, but this gives me something more to look into. Didn't make the modal work, because I though it was unnecessary. I also started playing around with Regular Expressions. I'm on this chapter with [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/09_regexp.html). 

**Link to works:** [Tweet Box](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/LJvLrG) 

### Day 20: Sept 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learning about JavaScript Regular Expressions aka Regex

**Thoughts:** I've been reading the Eloquent JavaScript book, a book I highly recommend to anyone who wants to dig a bit deeper into JavaScript. I'm on the chapter on Regular Expressions, but it got to a point where I started getting lost. Since I knew [Treehouse had a course on it](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/regular-expressions-in-javascript) I decided to start on it. The course gives you a breakdown on how regex works. Basically it's a way to write string patterns that you can test against. The course gives you a project so you can validate a form. This is pretty nifty.

**Link to works:** [Regex / Form Validation](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/ZMNZvg) 

### Day 21: Sept 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Regex Course

**Thoughts:** Finished the [Regex course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/regular-expressions-in-javascript) There's something wrong with the Telephone validation. Something is broke in there, but that's allright. The user, password, and email validators are working. Basically the tooltip will stop showing up once the conditions are met. This stuff is super cool.

### Day 22: Sept 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Image Slider with Vue

**Thoughts:** Made an Image Slider with Vue. Followed [this tutorial](https://matthiashager.com/image-slider-vuejs-tutorial). One thing I'm starting to notice when I do tutorials is I'm spotting syntax typos. I understand most of the code in this one. Not sure exactly what's going on in the computed function. All I know is that it's literally doing some math and makes the slider not crash, particularly when you hit the prev "button". 

**Link to works:** [Slide](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/YOmOeW) 

### Day 23: Sept 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Modular CSS with Sass

**Thoughts:** Today was a hard one. I tried waking up early because I knew I was going to be out all day. I did manage to do 45 minutes in the morning. I put in some extra 15 minutes almost at midgnigh. I started a course on [Treehouse on Modular Css](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/modular-css-with-sass) It's super interesting advanced stuff with SASS. Loving the fact that you can make funtions with SASS. 

**Link to works:** No link today

### Day 24: Sept 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started JavaScript 30 Course

**Thoughts:** I have been meaning to start this one for a while. I know lot's of folks that have started the 100 days challenge are familiar with [Wes Bos Build 30 Things in 30 Days with 30 Tutorials ](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/5aa411a64f754d18086b2db9/view/194130581) This are the kinds of projects are ready for now. I'm also still reading up on SASS, modular CSS, and generally trying to improve my CSS game. 

**Link to works:** [JavaScript Drumkit](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/bmNVwz)

### Day 25: Sept 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a Clock

**Thoughts:** Made a clock using CSS and Js by following the day #2 tutorial of Wes Bos JavaScript 30. It's a pretty clever sort of hack of using transform-origin, transform: rotate(), and the transition-timing-function property. The JS was just 20 lines and the trick is using the new Date function. Then it's all abou the setInterval function. Pretty cool stuff. I finished making this in about 30 - 35 minutes. I spent the remaining time watching the Treehouse tutorial on modular CSS with SASS.

### Day 26: Sept 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Updating CSS Variables with JS

**Thoughts:** Third project with Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course. Today is was about using CSS Variables, not SASS, but the new CSS variable implementation, and updating it with JS. Another thing I'm getting surprised about are these input range types that I didn't know. There's a couple of things I had forgotten about HTML. I didn't even know about <kbd> too. 
  
This was also a very quick project to complete. After I was done I started watching on [Treehouse the NPM Basics Course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/npm-basics)
